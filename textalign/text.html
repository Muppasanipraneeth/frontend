  <hr>
  <p>Tony Stark, who has inherited the defense contractor Stark Industries from his late father Howard Stark, is in war-torn Afghanistan 
with his friend and military liaison, Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes, to demonstrate the new "Jericho" missile. After the demonstration, 
his convoy is ambushed and Stark is critically wounded by a missile used by the attackersâ€”one of his company's own. He is captured and imprisoned 
in a cave by a terrorist group called the Ten Rings. Yinsen, a fellow captive and doctor, implants an electromagnet into Stark's chest to keep the 
shrapnel shards that wounded him from reaching his heart and killing him. Ten Rings leader Raza offers Stark freedom in exchange for building a Jericho 
missile for the group, but he and Yinsen believe that Raza will not keep his word.</p>
